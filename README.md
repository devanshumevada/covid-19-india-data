## Python Application
This application gives nationwide and state-wise Covid-19 cases numbers. This application returns Number of Active cases, deaths, confirmed cases and cured patients using voice commands.

### Example Commands
1. Nationwide data commands: 'Get the total number of confirmed cases nationwide' , 'Get the number of deaths nationwide', 'Get the number of active cases nationwide', 'Get the number of patients discharged nationwide'

2. State-specific commands: 'Get the number of confirmed cases in gujarat state', 'Get the number of deaths in gujarat state', 'Get the number of active cases in gujarat state', 'Get the number of patients discharged in gujarat state'

'state' keyword is necessary for state-specific commands as this application uses regular expressions to identify the type and the nature of the voice command.
