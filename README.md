## Covid 19 India Data

So I have recently learned React and this is the first project that I have made after learning it. Any suggestions or improvements are highly appreciated :) 

This web application Shows Statewise and Districtwise Covid 19 data with Bar chart for District wise Data for a state and a map plot for state wise data.

The project is live [here](https://covid-19-india-data-dashboard.web.app).

Here is a detailed walkthrough of the project.
